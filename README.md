# Framework-for-Air-Quality-Prediction-with-Time-Series-Analysis
Took inspiration from the work of Z. Zhao et al. in their paper titled A hybrid deep learning framework for air quality prediction with spatial autocorrelation during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Project Name: Air Quality Prediction During COVID-19 Lockdown

Description:
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on predicting air quality during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown using a dataset collected in Wuhan, China. The project employs machine learning techniques, exploratory data analysis, and time series analysis to provide valuable insights into the impact of lockdown measures on air pollution. The goal is to create a model that accurately predicts air quality based on various parameters.

The repository contains the Report associated with the source code Air_Quality_Prediction.ipynb. Refer to the same for any clarification.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the main script for air quality prediction.
Explore the results and insights provided by the project.
